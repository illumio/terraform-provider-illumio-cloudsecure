# illumio-cloudsecure_azure_flow_logs_storage_account (Resource)

Manages CloudSecure access to flow logs in an Azure Storage Account.

## Example Usage

```terraform
/*
  ⚠️ Internal Use Only: This resource is intended strictly for use within internal modules that
  directly manage Azure storage account registration for flow log ingestion in Illumio CloudSecure.

  Do not use this resource directly unless you are building or extending internal provisioning logic.

  For production and standard use cases, leverage the officially supported Illumio CloudSecure modules,
  which abstract permissions and configuration for secure, consistent deployment.

  Module documentation:
  https://registry.terraform.io/modules/illumio/cloudsecure/illumio/latest/submodules/azure_flow_logs_storage_accounts
*/

resource "illumio-cloudsecure_azure_flow_logs_storage_account" "managed_flow_log_storage_account" {
  subscription_id             = "c219f111-9005-45d4-8bb3-4d50120d3ef2"
  storage_account_resource_id = "/subscriptions/randomids-d469-aghg-a4b4-asdsdasadas/resourceGroups/azrg-illumio/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/illumioazuretest"
}


/*
  ✅ Recommended Approach: Use the official Illumio CloudSecure module to integrate Azure subscriptions and
   storage accounts with Illumio CloudSecure.

  These modules encapsulate authentication, role-based access, and flow log storage configuration,
  ensuring alignment with Illumio best practices and simplifying onboarding across environments.
