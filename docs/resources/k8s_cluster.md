## Schema

### Required

- `illumio_region` (String) Illumio Region where the k8s cluster will be onboarded. An Illumio Region is a designated cloud region where the CloudSecure cloud-operator deployed in the k8s cluster connects after onboarding. Choose the Illumio Region nearest to the k8s cluster to maximize performance and security. Must be one of: `aws-ap-southeast-2`, `aws-eu-west-2`, `aws-us-west-2`, `aws-us-west-1`, `aws-eu-west-2`, `azure-us-east-2`, `azure-germany-west-central`, `azure-us-west-2`.

### Read-Only

- `client_id` (String) Client identifier specific to the k8s cluster, used by CloudSecure's k8s operator to authenticate to CloudSecure, in combination with `client_secret`. Identical to `id`.
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive) Client secret specific to the k8s cluster, used by CloudSecure's k8s operator to authenticate to CloudSecure, in combination with `client_id`.
- `id` (String) CloudSecure ID.
